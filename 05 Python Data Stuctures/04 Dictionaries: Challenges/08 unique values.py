'''
  Create a function named unique_values that takes a dictionary named my_dictionary as a parameter. 
  The function should return the number of unique values in the dictionary.


Hint
Begin by creating a new empty list named seen_values. Loop through all of the values of my_dictionary. 
For every value, check to see if that value is in seen_values. If it is, continue to the next value. 
If it is not, add it to seen_values. After looping through all values, return the length of seen_values.

# Write your count_first_letter function here:

# Uncomment these function calls to test your  function:
#print(count_first_letter({"Stark": ["Ned", "Robb", "Sansa"], "Snow" : ["Jon"], "Lannister": ["Jaime", "Cersei", "Tywin"]}))
# should print {"S": 4, "L": 3}
#print(count_first_letter({"Stark": ["Ned", "Robb", "Sansa"], "Snow" : ["Jon"], "Sannister": ["Jaime", "Cersei", "Tywin"]}))
# should print {"S": 7}

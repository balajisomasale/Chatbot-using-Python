# Advanced NLP Topics
Believe it or not, you’ve just scratched the surface of natural language processing. 
There are a slew of advanced topics and applications of NLP, 
many of which rely on deep learning and neural networks.

Naive Bayes classifiers are supervised machine learning algorithms 
that leverage a probabilistic theorem to make predictions and classifications. 
They are widely used for sentiment analysis (determining whether a given block of language 
expresses negative or positive feelings) and spam filtering.

We’ve made enormous gains in machine translation,
but even the most advanced translation software using neural networks and LSTM still has 
far to go in accurately translating between languages.

Some of the most life-altering applications of NLP are focused on improving language accessibility
for people with disabilities. Text-to-speech functionality and speech recognition have improved rapidly
thanks to neural language models, making digital spaces far more accessible places.

NLP can also be used to detect bias in writing and speech. Feel like a political candidate, book,
or news source is biased but can’t put your finger on exactly how? Natural language processing can 
help you identify the language at issue.

## Instructions
1.Assign review a string with a brief review of this lesson so far. Next, run your code.
Is the Naive Bayes Classifier accurately classifying your review?

```python
from reviews import counter, training_counts
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

# Add your review:
review = "Review is is the review which gives the defination of the review for the deveopment of group of reviews in a library"
review_counts = counter.transform([review])

classifier = MultinomialNB()
training_labels = [0] * 1000 + [1] * 1000

classifier.fit(training_counts, training_labels)
  
neg = (classifier.predict_proba(review_counts)[0][0] * 100).round()
pos = (classifier.predict_proba(review_counts)[0][1] * 100).round()

if pos > 50:
  print("Thank you for your positive review!")
elif neg > 50:
  print("We're sorry this hasn't been the best possible lesson for you! We're always looking to improve.")
else:
  print("Naive Bayes cannot determine if this is negative or positive. Thank you or we're sorry?")

  
print("\nAccording to our trained Naive Bayes classifier, 
the probability that your review was negative was {0}% and the probability it was positive was {1}%.".format(neg, pos))
